# uohack_hack_game
a hacker game for the UOttawahack 2018




## GAEME
this game is a classic hacker game in which two people will input two different programs,
where the programs compete against each other at the barest of metal to take control of the
computer. The game will run each program line by line, one file after each other until either
one player is the majority owner of the ram.
